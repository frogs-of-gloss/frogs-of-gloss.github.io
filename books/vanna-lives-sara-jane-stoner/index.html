  <h2>Vanna Lives, or: Vanna White is Alive and Well in Southern California <span>by Sara Jane Stoner // cover by Morgan Vo</span></h2>
  <p><em>To what has your Wheel been yoked? To what hasn&rsquo;t it? In the raucous spit of a thousand missing letters, special correspondent Stoner sends us her reports on the marriage of Hell and the American living room. To be read beneath the diamond sharp gleam of a professional smile. Is it laughter? Is it crisis? We&rsquo;ll wake you when it&rsquo;s it over, and over, and over again.</em></p>
