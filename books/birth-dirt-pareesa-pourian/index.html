  <h2>birth dirt <span>by Pareesa Pourian</span></h2>
  <p><em>birth dirt is for the birds. Amidst a temporary collapse of time and space, colors have awakened their stranger hues. Durand turns the eye to what continues to flitter, turns the eye into an usher of acknowledgment, turns the eye into the mind of the tired mind, to unravel emptiness down to the fullness therein.</em></p>

  <p><a href="https://eastriverparkaction.org/donate/" target="_blank">East River Park Action</a> opposes the East Side Coastal Resiliency plan that will demolish East River Park in Lower Manhattan. The cityâ€™s development plan is an environmental injustice against our crowded low-and-middle income Lower East Side and East Village neighborhood that will suffer the effects of losing our only large green space and the effects of outsized construction on our health.</p>
