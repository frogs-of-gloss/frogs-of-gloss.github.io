  <h2>birth dirt <span>by Pareesa Pourian</span></h2>
  <p><em>Where do you come from? Well, where are you now? Pourian draws it out with wet paint, fingers deep in the mud, air thick with steam. These are lines to stick in the earth, scratching around ’til something viscous bubbles forth. Make yourself a hole, then it’s straight down the hatch, bound for the fires deep down in the core.</em></p>

    <p class="title">where i come from</p>

    <p class="line">electrically rolled in wind</p>
    <p class="line">grumbling</p>

    <p class="line stanza">spit up heat</p>
    <p class="line">all over under clothes</p>

    <p class="line stanza">sky lights blood</p>
    <p class="line">pink squandered babies</p>

    <p class="line stanza">hammered gold clutched</p>
    <p class="line">threaded through flesh</p>

    <p class="line stanza">moldy placeholder of</p>
    <p class="line">mossy bed</p>

    <p class="line stanza">stamen stains</p>
    <p class="line">crushed petals sunned</p>

    <p class="line stanza">some asses jiggled</p>
    <p class="line">curiosity’s face</p>
