  <h2>saltsitting <span>by Imani Elizabeth Jackson</span></h2>
  <p><em>A teaching, a reaching for, a dash to taste. Making place out of a hole in the earth, would be better if you had a lamp to read by. Jackson aims her warm and steady light straight at the surface of things, making plain the long shadows our taking makes. Like a prism held close to the eye, saltsitting unlocks with each turn of its angles: musical, medicinal, material inquiries into the lines that drift between erosion and recuperation.</em></p>

  <p class="title">A shift in temperature, a drop in climate, pink sound</p>
    
  <p class="line stanza">The rain&rsquo;s music always be more insistent than the drumming</p>
  <p class="line">across the way / and she don&rsquo;t know the stomach from the</p>
  <p class="line">core of the earthworks, or the difference between mining and</p>
  <p class="line">the mine she&rsquo;s made / This breathplace / A drum beat can get</p>
  <p class="line">off / lose its rhythm</p>
    
  <p class="line stanza">Rain or no rain, it&rsquo;s salinous cold and time to eat, to breathe</p>
  <p class="line">(it is rhythm)</p>

  <p>From <a href="https://umedics.org/donate/" target="_blank">Ujima Medics</a>: &ldquo;South and West Side Chicagoans live in abject terror of falling victim to gun violence. While we work hard to change the systemic causes of such violence, we want our communities trained in emergency first response skills. So gather your friends, neighbors, team, school, church, mosque, block club, fraternity, sorority, gang, book club, or any other kind of group you may belong to and let us teach you the skills to keep us alive in crisis.&rsquo;</p>
