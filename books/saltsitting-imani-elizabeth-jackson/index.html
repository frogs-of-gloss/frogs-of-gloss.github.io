  <h2>saltsitting <span>by Imani Elizabeth Jackson</span></h2>
  <p><em>We&rsquo;re counting the days &rsquo;til we leave Missoula, we&rsquo;re counting the does on the walk to and from campus, we&rsquo;re counting the last cigarette. Not a catalogue, but a transmutation: the grace of numerology, the register of pain on a scale from one to ten. Szymaszek prepares us for potential encounters with wild cats, for the invasive friendliness of the local cashier, for the formative process of detailing that turns the merely adequate into something astonishing. We&rsquo;re after a knowledge that can&rsquo;t be known before knowing. We&rsquo;re strength training in a new state.</em></p>
