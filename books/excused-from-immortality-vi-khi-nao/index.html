  <p class="title">RHYTHM OF LIGHT</p>

  <p class="line stanza">I am walking away from all of this</p>
  <p class="line stanza">This unit of light</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Words without any tongues</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Mountains without climbers</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Despair without consciousnesses</p>
  <p class="line stanza">The rhythm of light</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Chases each heartbeat out of its well</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Of profusion</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Where do tear ducts go if they don’t release</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Nutrients of melancholy</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Where do my purse sleep if I leave it</p>
  <p class="line stanza">For the policeman of consumption</p>
  <p class="line stanza">To keep it awake</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Night and day</p>
  <p class="line stanza">I am walking away from the sun</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Teaching her that the tongue isn’t</p>
  <p class="line stanza">An instrument of rebirth</p>
  <p class="line stanza">But a way in without a way out</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Yesterday the sun is forced to wear</p>
  <p class="line stanza">A facemask made of cumulus clouds</p>
  <p class="line stanza">A way for authors to hide her boobs amongst her books</p>
  <p class="line stanza">A way for a brook to stop singing her way into an ocean</p>
  <p class="line stanza">I am a heartache amongst ruins</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Throw stones at me</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Open this drain inside</p>
  <p class="line stanza">When her mask is removed, like me and you,</p>
  <p class="line stanza">The sun is capable of giving radiation</p>
  <p class="line stanza">If only to terror & despair</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Instead of my little brother whom I love</p>
