  <p class="title">MY ASS</p>
  
  <p class="line stanza">I told him to kick my ass</p>
  <p class="line stanza">But, in a romantically compromised situation</p>
  <p class="line stanza">He gave my letters a new heartbeat</p>
  <p class="line stanza">One which makes my ass look like it has a future</p>
  <p class="line stanza">So round it could bounce Jupiter off the infinite cosmos</p>
  <p class="line stanza">So take my cashews away from me</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Make me almond my ass for you</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Make me pistachio my foe</p>
  <p class="line stanza">Who is ready to lay down his fate</p>
  <p class="line stanza">For this poor walnut which is no peanut</p>
