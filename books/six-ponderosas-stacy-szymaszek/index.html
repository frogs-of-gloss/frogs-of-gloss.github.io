  <h2>Six Ponderosas <span>by Stacy Szymaszek</span></h2>
  <p><em>We&rsquo;re counting the days &rsquo;til we leave Missoula, we&rsquo;re counting the does on the walk to and from campus, we&rsquo;re counting the last cigarette. Not a catalogue, but a transmutation: the grace of numerology, the register of pain on a scale from one to ten. Szymaszek prepares us for potential encounters with wild cats, for the invasive friendliness of the local cashier, for the formative process of detailing that turns the merely adequate into something astonishing. We&rsquo;re after a knowledge that can&rsquo;t be known before knowing. We&rsquo;re strength training in a new state.</em></p>

    <p class="title">THE WEATHER ON THE MOUNTAIN IS HOT</p>
    
    <p class="line">I can describe it better than the weather in my own</p>
    <p class="line">              body</p>
    <p class="line">I wonder        if my mother wasn&rsquo;t alive</p>
    <p class="line">would my extended family see each other?</p>
      
    <p class="line stanza">sometimes too much internal wind can create</p>
    <p class="line">tics like the one I get     each December</p>
    <p class="line">            in my eye</p>
      
    <p class="line stanza">I just put it together       the freak horn</p>
    <p class="line">blowing yesterday</p>
    <p class="line">                                      homecoming</p>
    <p class="line">                                      weekend</p>
      
    <p class="line stanza">it&rsquo;s just as I thought</p>
    <p class="line">the loss of 2nd Ave.</p>
    <p class="line">            has been hard </p>
    <p class="line">            ambulating</p>
    <p class="line">                        has been the way</p>
    <p class="line">                        to my heart       I am composing</p>
      
    <p class="line stanza">this in my head as we walk</p>
    <p class="line">we being you and me</p>
    <p class="line">            the battalion of crickets at my feet</p>
    <p class="line">were they to carry anything other than their own rhythm</p>
    <p class="line">would be epidemic</p>
      
    <p class="line stanza">            a solo deer</p>
    <p class="line">            two crows</p>
    <p class="line">and a wasp decimating a fly</p>
    <p class="line">on my sleeve</p>
      
    <p class="line stanza">responsible for my own walks</p>
    <p class="line">and to a lesser extent</p>
    <p class="line">my own weather          I sweat in my</p>
        
    <p class="line stanza">                        vest     that was perfectly comfortable    100 feet</p>
    <p class="line">                        down</p>
    <p class="line">change</p>
    <p class="line">has happened</p>
    <p class="line">too slowly                     when it’s not happening</p>
    <p class="line">                        so fast</p>
    
    <p class="line stanza">                                                            <em>October 7, 2018</em></p>
