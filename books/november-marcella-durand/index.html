  <h2>November <span>by Marcella Durand</span></h2>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="title">11.20.20</p>

    <p class="line">It is like December</p>
    <p class="line">and still November,</p>
    <p class="line stanza">November is still,</p>
    <p class="line">and not still, trees</p>
    <p class="line stanza">are not still, sky is</p>
    <p class="line">not still and still it</p>
    <p class="line stanza">is November: gray</p>
    <p class="line">russet month, russeting</p>
    <p class="line stanza">unleaving, deleafing,</p>
    <p class="line">unfoliating, blowing,</p>
    <p class="line stanza">losing, bareness, barely</p>
    <p class="line">a tree, only a long branch, dark</p>
    <p class="line stanza">against more darkness,</p>
    <p class="line">earlier and less light.</p>
  </div>

  <p><a href="https://eastriverparkaction.org/donate/" target="_blank">East River Park Action</a> opposes the East Side Coastal Resiliency plan that will demolish East River Park in Lower Manhattan. The cityâ€™s development plan is an environmental injustice against our crowded low-and-middle income Lower East Side and East Village neighborhood that will suffer the effects of losing our only large green space and the effects of outsized construction on our health.</p>
