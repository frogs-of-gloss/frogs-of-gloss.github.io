  <h2>November <span>by Marcella Durand</span></h2>
  <p><em>description</em></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p class="title">11.3.20</p>
    <p class="line">Birds rhyme with obsession</p>
    <p class="line">and stillness.</p>
    <p class="line">I focus on </p>
    <p class="line">a stand of grass</p>
    <p class="line">that, like the Americas,</p>
    <p class="line">looked “empty” or </p>
    <p class="line">were presented as </p>
    <p class="line">such to facilitate the grabbing</p>
    <p class="line">of the blood/gold/bodies.</p>
    <p class="line">Ripe stands of goldenrod</p>
    <p class="line">go to fuzz and seeds,</p>
    <p class="line">stripes of vegetation give</p>
    <p class="line">way to shape and movement—</p>
    <p class="line">my eye focuses and seeds</p>
    <p class="line">and stripes resolve</p>
    <p class="line">to an entire flock</p>
    <p class="line">of birds that turn</p>
    <p class="line">out to be “rare,” but</p>
    <p class="line">in the endless big city, </p>
    <p class="line">every bird is rare—</p>
    <p class="line">the lizard-like</p>
    <p class="line">northern flickers on </p>
    <p class="line">high oak trees, all red</p>
    <p class="line">and spots and brown,</p>
    <p class="line">yellow-shafted tails, yellow</p>
    <p class="line">of which brings me to </p>
    <p class="line">the yellow-rumped warblers, </p>
    <p class="line">long and sharp-eyed, the</p>
    <p class="line">expression in their eyes</p>
    <p class="line">so different from the cute</p>
    <p class="line">round-eyed kinglets, feathery</p>
    <p class="line">circles in flight with bright </p>
    <p class="line">tufts as ruby or gold.</p>
    <p class="line">All these birds in solidago,</p>
    <p class="line">stalks growing on concrete</p>
    <p class="line">through tilting chain-link fences</p>
    <p class="line">that rattle with wind and</p>
    <p class="line">passing bicyclists—a woman</p>
    <p class="line">between the stands of flowers</p>
    <p class="line">and the river gathers armfuls</p>
    <p class="line">of something—nettles? mugwort?</p>
    <p class="line">There is much mugwort</p>
    <p class="line">to be had here; it spreads </p>
    <p class="line">quickly and grows tall. Along</p>
    <p class="line">the highway are hidden gardens</p>
    <p class="line">of squash and kale—like the birds,</p>
    <p class="line">invisible, in a space they are not,</p>
    <p class="line">and twigs actually garden tools.</p>

  <p><a href="https://eastriverparkaction.org/donate/" target="_blank">East River Park Action</a> opposes the East Side Coastal Resiliency plan that will demolish East River Park in Lower Manhattan. The city’s development plan is an environmental injustice against our crowded low-and-middle income Lower East Side and East Village neighborhood that will suffer the effects of losing our only large green space and the effects of outsized construction on our health.</p>
